# Motel

A hotel booking web application built using MERN stack. Motel : A hotel booking web application. I took inspiration from airbnb design and tried to recreate a hotel booking web app using MERN stack. I took it beyond from just a hotel booking app to able to host a house/hotel also. Simplifying user interactivity and making the app seamless both book a hotel and host a hotel was the key goal of this project.
